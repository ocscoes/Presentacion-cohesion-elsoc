_"We believe that a good deﬁnition of social cohesion, just like any other concepts in the social sciences, should be judged in terms of two criteria: (1) .red[minimal] in scope and (2) close to .red[ordinary usage_]" (p.280).

"_Social cohesion is a state of aﬀairs concerning both the **vertical** and the **horizontal** interactions among members of society as characterized by a set of attitudes and norms that includes .red[trust], a sense of .red[belonging] and the willingness to .red[participate and help], as well as their behavioural manifestations_".

# International social cohesion survey projects

* Mapping Social cohesion (Canada 1998)

* Scanlon-Monash Index of Social Cohesion (Australia 2007-2019)

* Social cohesion radar (Germany-International)

* Civic engagement and Social cohesion report (USA 2014)

* ECOsociAL (seven Latin American countries 2007)

???
Each of these studies has proposed different definitions of social cohesion, accompanied by different forms of operationalization. As a result, there are different dimensions, sub-dimensions and indicators that seek to measure social cohesion across these projects. Some of these dimensions are common among studies, but most of them present wide differences in their operationalization, combining indicators that in some studies are presented as sub-dimensions and in others constitute differentiated dimensions. As a result of conceptual differences, the nesting structure of dimensions and sub-dimensions is different between projects, which makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between the experiences reviewed.
