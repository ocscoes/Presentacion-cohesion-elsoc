First of all, a few words about the research center in which this paper is framed.

The Center of Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies was born in 2013 funded by a grant of our national research agency ANID. We have four research lines covering socieconomic, interactional, political and territorial aspects of social conflict and cohesion. Currently there are about 50 researchers involved, who are academics from four of the largest universities in Chile.

Part of our efforts have been related with the conceptualization and measurement of social cohesion, and the present paper is part of this enterprise.
