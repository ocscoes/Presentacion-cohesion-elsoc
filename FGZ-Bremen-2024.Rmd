.right-column[

- Probabilistic, stratified (by the size of cities), clustered, and multistage. 

- The sample -in its first measurement- is representative of the urban population living in cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants. This is equivalent to approximately 77% of the country's total population and 93% of the urban population.

## Some international social cohesion survey projects

* Mapping Social cohesion (Canada 1998)

* Scanlon-Monash Index of Social Cohesion (Australia 2007-2019)

* Social cohesion radar (Germany-International)

* Civic engagement and Social cohesion report (USA 2014)

* ECOsociAL (seven Latin American countries 2007)

* (FGZ Social Cohesion Panel 2021 ->)


???
Each of these studies has proposed different definitions of social cohesion, accompanied by different forms of operationalization. As a result, there are different dimensions, sub-dimensions and indicators that seek to measure social cohesion across these projects. Some of these dimensions are common among studies, but most of them present wide differences in their operationalization, combining indicators that in some studies are presented as sub-dimensions and in others constitute differentiated dimensions. As a result of conceptual differences, the nesting structure of dimensions and sub-dimensions is different between projects, which makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between the experiences reviewed.

The common dimensions accross projects are the following, and based on these communalities our objective was to organize them into the more general framework from Chan, To and Chan (vertical/horizontal), creating a new framework for defining and measuring social cohesion

And we are in this situation, trying to make a standard based on the communalities of previous standards, and so generating another one.
