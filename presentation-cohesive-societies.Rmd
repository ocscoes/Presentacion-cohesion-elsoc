First of all, a few words about the research center in which this paper is framed.

The Center of Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies was born in 2013 funded by a grant of our national research agency ANID. We have four research lines covering socieconomic, interactional, political and territorial aspects of social conflict and cohesion. Currently there are about 50 researchers involved, who are academics from four of the largest universities in Chile.

Part of our efforts have been related with the conceptualization and measurement of social cohesion, and the present paper is part of this enterprise.

this is not a research paper, is mostly a review of social cohesion studies and an effort to find common aspects across them which allow us to propose a conceptual and measurement framework

# International survey research projects on social cohesion

* Mapping Social cohesion (Canada 1998)

* Scanlon-Monash Index of Social Cohesion (Australia 2007-2019)

* Social cohesion radar (Germany-International)

* Civic engagement and Social cohesion report (USA 2014)

* ECOsociAL (seven Latin American countries 2007)

???
Each of these studies has proposed different definitions of social cohesion, accompanied by different forms of operationalization. As a result, there are different dimensions, sub-dimensions and indicators that seek to measure social cohesion across these projects. Some of these dimensions are common among studies, but most of them present wide differences in their operationalization, combining indicators that in some studies are presented as sub-dimensions and in others constitute differentiated dimensions. As a result of conceptual differences, the nesting structure of dimensions and sub-dimensions is different between projects, which makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between the experiences reviewed.

_"We believe that a good deﬁnition of social cohesion, just like any other concepts in the social sciences, should be judged in terms of two criteria: (1) .red[minimal] in scope and (2) close to .red[ordinary usage_]" (p.280).

"_Social cohesion is a state of aﬀairs concerning both the **vertical** and the **horizontal** interactions among members of society as characterized by a set of attitudes and norms that includes .red[trust], a sense of .red[belonging] and the willingness to .red[participate and help], as well as their behavioural manifestations_".
